# CLSEngineUI
Chemical Lab Simulation Engine User Interface


## [TODO]
* Process of using 
1. User creates chemical instruments
2. User configs the reactants in the containers
3. Send the "INIT" signal to object tracing equipment and get the reponse containing the world position of the instruments prepared to be traced.
4. Draw these instruments in right position in AR scene
5. User places the real objects (3D-printed) in the right position
6. Send the "START" signal to start object tracing
7. User move the real objects and get the data simutaneously from the back-end
8. Draw the virtual objects as the real ones moving
